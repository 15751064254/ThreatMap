# ThreatMap
This project creates a map to show threats hitting the firewall at the organization of your choice. (Current location is Chattanooga, TN) [Currently, the project only makes "faux threats" that are generated by testDataGen.py]

To start the server, you must have NodeJS installed. 

Open a terminal, navigate to the location of the folder, and run the following: 

node testServer.js

After that is running, navigate to:

http://localhost:3000

From there, run the file testDataGen.py


Now all that's left is to watch the show on the site running on localhost:3000.
